## Usage

Example:

```
python showExample.py 5
```

for visualizing the frames.  
Close the poped up image for next frame.

Ctrl+C to terminate the script.

## Requirements

This script is written in python 2.7, if it fails to start, use:  
```
python2.7 showExample.py 5
```

If the program still doesn't run, it probably needs these python libraries.  
numpy (1.13.1)  
moviepy (0.2.3.2)  
matplotlib (2.0.2)  
bitarray (0.8.1)  

```
pip install numpy==1.13.1 moviepy==0.2.3.2 matplotlib==2.0.2 bitarray==0.8.1
```

## Required files

The folders: `f4k_extracted_image\`, `f4ktable\`, `misc\`, `output\`, and `final\` needed to be in the same directory as `showExample.py`.  
You can change the directory manually in `showExample.py` as well.
